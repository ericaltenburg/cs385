These are various coding projects done in CS 385 - Algorithms at Stevens Institute of Techonology (S19).

## Description

This is a course on more complex data structures, and algorithm design and analysis, using the C++ language. Topics include: advanced and/or balanced search trees; hashing; further asymptotic complexity analysis; standard algorithm design techniques; graph algorithms; complex sort algorithms; and other “classic” algorithms that serve as examples of design techniques. 

***Cheaters beware, Dr. Borowski has an archive of my code and tests it with MOSS.***
